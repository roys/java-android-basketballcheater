### Basketball cheater for Messenger
**tl;dr:** This is a script that you can run with *gradle* or *Android Studio* to improve your score in Facebook
Messenger's basketball game. If you aren't a developer you probably don't want to check out this further. If you are a
developer you can just checkout and try it yourself.

#### FAQ
**Q: ** What's the high score with this script? I've only tried it for a few runs, but I got a decent 58. I'm sure the
sky's the limit with some tweaking.
